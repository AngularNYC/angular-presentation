So that everyone can feel welcome we ask you to please uphold this code should you decide to contribute to this project.

## Contributing to the Codelab


### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug while going the codelab as a student, you can submit feedback through the blue feedback button in the bottom-right corner.


#### Before Sending Feedback

Please check out the previous comments to ensure this problem hasn't already been reported!


#### Submitting a Report

Feedback form submissions are magically converted to [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

* Include a clear and descriptive header that summarizes the issue
* Make sure you explain the problem and include any relevant details
* Describe the steps you followed to encounter the issue if you can remember them
* Explain what behavior you expected to see instead
* Feel free to include any suggestions if you have them âœ¨


-----


### Opening Issues on GitHub

Before opening a new issue, please check the existing ones to confirm it isn't on file yet.

If opening an issue, please include:
* A succinct and illustrative title
* A helpful description
* Current and expected behavior
* If a suggestion for improvement, how you think the suggestion can improve the project
* Any other details if necessary like screenshots


----


### Contributing Code

If you don't know where to start, you can peruse issues marked by `help-wanted` tags

If you want to work on something there isn't yet an issue for, consider submitting an issue so that multiple contributers aren't _unknowingly_ working on solving the same problem in parallel


### Making a Pull Request

* Don't forget to pull from the master branch and resolve any merge conflicts first!
* If you don't have access to the repo, fork the project and make a PR from there
* Describe what the PR addresses
* Include screenshots and descriptive explanations if necessary


------


## On Style


### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense
* If applicable, reference the issue being resolved


### Code Style

Angular Codelab comes with its own linter settings. If you're not sure your linter is picking up on them, please run `ng lint` and fix any styling errors before submitting.
